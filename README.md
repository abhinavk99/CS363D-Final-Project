## Description

We are analyzing a dataset containing the outcomes of H-2B applications taken during fiscal year 2019, taken from the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (a branch under the US Department of Labor).

We have cleaned and engineered the data such that it is a binary classification problem (either an application is certified or denied), and developed a soft voting ensemble classifier incorporating various supervised classifiers as a predictive model for this purpose.

**NB: We have received explicit permission from our professor to make this repository public.**
